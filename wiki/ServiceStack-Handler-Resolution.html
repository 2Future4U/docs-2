<p>This document explains how the handlers are resolved in ServiceStack, the moment the Context is passed on to the ServiceStackHttpHandlerFactory, and all the actions that happen along with it.</p>

<p>The order of execution is as below, and the first one to be match is executed.</p>

<ol>
<li>Iterates through the RawHttpHandlers in the order they were added to EndpointConfig.</li>
<li>If its a root request ("/"):

<ul>
<li>Correct requests "/default.aspx" and "/Default.aspx" to "/", as WebDav Server automatically appends them. </li>
<li>Iterate through CatchAllHandlers for a match, and if no match is found return DefaultHandler.
(Note: DefaultHandler is DefaultHttpHandler if its hosted on the root path or running in a Mono environment. If not, it translates to NonRootModeDefaultHttpHandler)</li>
<li>Check if a file exists with the name DefaultRootFileName mentioned in the EndpointConfig.

<ul>
<li>If it doesn't exist, return IndexPageHttpHandler</li>
<li>If exists, DefaultHttpHandler is invoked to serve the file if its an allowed extension. If not, ForbiddenHttpHandler is invoked.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Searches the Service Route Collection for the path. If found, RestHandler is invoked.</li>
<li>If its a file system path, and no matches so far:

<ul>
<li>If its a directory, and it exists, but the path does not have the "/" suffix, RedirectHttpHandler invoked with the trailing "/".</li>
<li>CatchAllHanders are checked for matches.</li>
<li>If file doesn't exist, NotFoundHttpHandler is invoked.</li>
<li>If exists, DefaultHttpHandler is invoked to serve the file if its an allowed extension. If not, ForbiddenHttpHandler is invoked.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CatchAllHanders are checked for matches.</li>
<li>If FallbackRestPath is configured RestHander is invoked.</li>
<li>Resolution fails.</li>
</ol>

<p>TODO: This document is not complete, and is just a rough draft. There are still a few more attempts left in the resolution process.</p>
