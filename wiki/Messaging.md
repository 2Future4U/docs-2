## API

ServiceStack provides a [high-level Messaging API](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Interfaces/Messaging/) exposing a number of essential messaging features in order to publish and receive messages as well as registering and processing handlers for different message types. A class diagram of the core interfaces is below:

![Messaging API](https://raw.github.com/mythz/rabbitmq-windows/master/img/messaging-api.png)

There are currently 4 supported MQ Server options:

  - [Rabbit MQ Server](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Rabbit-MQ)
  - [Redis MQ Server](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Messaging-and-Redis)
  - [Amazon SQS MQ Server](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Aws#sqsmqserver)
  - [InMemory MQ Service](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/Messaging/InMemoryTransientMessageService.cs)

Like other ServiceStack providers, all MQ Servers are interchangeable, visible in the shared MQ Server tests below:

  - [MqServerIntroTests.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/tests/ServiceStack.Server.Tests/Messaging/MqServerIntroTests.cs)
  - [MqServerAppHostTests.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/tests/ServiceStack.Common.Tests/Messaging/MqServerAppHostTests.cs)

## Benefits of Message Queues

One of the benefits of using ServiceStack is its integrated support for hosting MQ Servers
allowing your Services to be invoked via a MQ Broker. There are a number of reasons why you'd want 
to use a MQ as an alternative to HTTP including:
    
  - Sender is decoupled from Receiver, eliminating point-to-point coupling and configuration
  - Allows no-touch deploy of new clients and servers without updating any configuration
  - Removes time-coupling allowing clients and servers to be deployed independently without downtime
  - Better reliability, consumers can still send messages when servers are down and vice-versa
  - Durable, messages can be persisted and survive application or server reboots
  - Allows for CPU Intensive or long operations without disrupting message workflow
  - Instant response times by queuing slow operations and executing them in the background
  - Allows for natural load-balancing where throughput can be increased by simply adding more processors or servers
  - Message-based design allows for easier parallelization and introspection of computations
  - Greater throttling and control of message throughput, message execution can be determined by server
  - Reduces request contention and can defer execution of high load spikes over time
  - Better recovery, messages generating server exceptions can be retried and maintained in a dead-letter-queue
  - DLQ messages can be introspected, fixed and later replayed after server updates and rejoin normal message workflow

More details of these and other advantages can be found in the definitive
[Enterprise Integration Patterns](http://www.eaipatterns.com).

### OneWay MQ and HTTP Service Clients are Substitutable

Service Clients and MQ Clients are also interoperable where all MQ Clients implement the Service Clients `IOneWayClient` API which enables writing code that works with both HTTP and MQ Clients:

```csharp
IOneWayClient client = GetClient();
client.SendOneWay(new RequestDto { ... });
```

Likewise the HTTP Service Clients implement the Messaging API `IMessageProducer`:

```csharp
void Publish<T>(T requestDto);
void Publish<T>(IMessage<T> message);
```

When publishing a `IMessage<T>` the message metadata are sent as HTTP Headers with an `X-` prefix.

## MQ Client Architecture

By promoting clean (endpoint-ignorant and dependency-free) Service and DTO classes, your web services are instantly re-usable from non-http contexts like MQ Services. 

Within MQ Services, Request DTO's get wrapped and sent within the [IMessage](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Interfaces/Messaging/IMessage.cs) body, which looks like:

![ServiceStack MQ Client Architecture](http://mono.servicestack.net/files/servicestack-mqclients.png) 

## MQ Server Architecture

The Server Architecture shows where MQ Hosts (in green) fits within the context of ServiceStack's Request Pipeline.
Effectively MQ Services are treated as "internal Services" bypassing HTTP Web Services Content Negotiation and Global Request/Response Filters:

![ServiceStack Logical Architecture View](http://mono.servicestack.net/files/servicestack-logical-view-02.png) 

MQ Services also have their own distinct `GlobalMessageRequestFilters` and `GlobalMessageResponseFilters` for registering custom logic that only applies to MQ Requests. Plugins like [Validation Feature](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Validation#validation-feature) can execute custom behavior for both HTTP and MQ Services by registering it in [both HTTP GlobalRequestFilters and MQ GlobalMessageRequestFilters](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/fc191835d97e5b6d89d3cd7a4742793af44eb8c3/src/ServiceStack/Validation/ValidationFeature.cs#L25-L29), e.g:

```csharp
appHost.GlobalRequestFilters.Add(ValidationFilters.RequestFilter);
appHost.GlobalMessageRequestFilters.Add(ValidationFilters.RequestFilter);
```

## Authenticated Requests via MQ

As MQ Requests aren't executed within the Context of a HTTP Request they don't have access to any HTTP Info like HTTP Cookies, Headers, FormData, etc. This also means the Users Session isn't typically available as it's based on the [ss-id Session Ids in Cookies](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Sessions).

As ServiceStack also lets you specify a Users Session ids using HTTP Headers (with `X-` prefix), we can instead specify Session Ids using Request Headers. To do this we can create a custom Request Context that the MQ Service is executed within and set the SessionId in the Headers:

```csharp
var req = new BasicRequest { Verb = HttpMethods.Post };
req.Headers["X-ss-id"] = sessionId;
```

Alternatively we can inject the Session itself. As a Users Session is just a `AuthUserSession` POCO persisted against the SessionId, we can access the Users Session from the CacheClient directly ourselves, e.g:

```csharp
//i.e. urn:iauthsession:{sessionId}
var sessionKey = SessionFeature.GetSessionKey(sessionId); 
var usersSession  = HostContext.TryResolve<ICacheClient>()
    .Get<IAuthUserSession>(sessionKey);
```

And inject to use this Session with:

```csharp
req.Items["__session"] = usersSession;
```

We can then Execute the MQ Service with this custom Request Context with:

```csharp
return this.ServiceController.ExecuteMessage(m, req);
```

> See the [Session docs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Sessionsï»¿) for more info about Sessions in ServiceStack

We'll walk-through a minimal example using this approach to make authenticated Requests and access the Users Session in a Service that's accessible via both HTTP and MQ transports.

To start we'll configure an Authentication-enabled ServiceStack MQ and HTTP Self-Hosted Application:

```csharp
public class AppHost : AppSelfHostBase
{
    public override void Configure(Container container)
    {
        //Enable Authentication
        Plugins.Add(new AuthFeature(() => new AuthUserSession(), 
            new IAuthProvider[] {
                new CredentialsAuthProvider(AppSettings),  // Enable Username/Password Authentication
            }));

        //Use an InMemory Repository to persist User Authenticaiton Info
        container.Register<IUserAuthRepository>(c => new InMemoryAuthRepository());

        //Create a new User on Startup
        var authRepo = container.Resolve<IUserAuthRepository>();
        authRepo.CreateUserAuth(new UserAuth {
            Id = 1,
            UserName = "mythz",
            FirstName = "John",
            LastName = "Doe",
            DisplayName = "John Doe",
        }, "p@55word");

        //Register to use a Rabbit MQ Server
        container.Register<IMessageService>(c => new RabbitMqServer());

        var mqServer = container.Resolve<IMessageService>();

        mqServer.RegisterHandler<AuthOnly>(m => {
            var req = new BasicRequest { Verb = HttpMethods.Post };
            req.Headers["X-ss-id"] = m.GetBody().SessionId;
            var response = ServiceController.ExecuteMessage(m, req);
            return response;
        });

        //Start the Rabbit MQ Server listening for incoming MQ Requests
        mqServer.Start();
    }
}
```

and now add the Service Implementation:

```csharp
public class AuthOnly : IReturn<AuthOnlyResponse>
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string SessionId { get; set; }
}

public class AuthOnlyResponse
{
    public string Result { get; set; }
}

public class AuthOnlyService : Service 
{
    [Authenticate] //Only allow Authenticated Requests
    public object Any(AuthOnly request)
    {
        var session = base.SessionAs<AuthUserSession>(); // Get the User Session for this Request

        return new AuthOnlyResponse {
            Result = "Hello, {0}! Your UserName is {1}"
                .Fmt(request.Name, session.UserAuthName)
        };
    }
}
```

With the ServiceStack Host and Service implemented, we can start listening to both HTTP and Rabbit MQ Requests by starting the AppHost:

```csharp
new AppHost().Start("http://localhost:1337/");
```

Then on the Client we can authenticate using UserName/Password credentials using the HTTP [Service Client](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/C%23-client), e.g:

```csharp
var client = new JsonServiceClient("http://localhost:1337/");

var response = client.Post(new Authenticate {
    UserName = "mythz",
    Password = "p@55word",
    RememberMe = true,
});

var sessionId = response.SessionId;
```

The above Request establishes an authenticated Session with the `JsonServiceClient` instance which has its Cookies populated with the Users SessionIds - allowing it to make subsequent authenticated requests as that User. 

To make Authenticated Requests via MQ we can pass the returned `sessionId` into the MQ Request:

```csharp
var mqFactory = RabbitMqMessageFactory();
using (var mqClient = mqFactory.CreateMessageQueueClient())
{
    mqClient.Publish(new AuthOnly {                        
        Name = "RabbitMQ Request",
        SessionId = sessionId,
    });

    //Block until the Response is Received:
    var responseMsg = mqClient.Get<AuthOnlyResponse>(QueueNames<AuthOnlyResponse>.In);
    mqClient.Ack(responseMsg); //Acknowledge the message was received
    
    Console.WriteLine(responseMsg.GetBody().Result); //"Hello, RabbitMQ Request! Your UserName is mythz"
}
```

This works since we're extracting the SessionId and injecting into a Custom Request Context used by the MQ Service:

```csharp
mqServer.RegisterHandler<AuthOnly>(m => {
    var req = new BasicRequest { Verb = HttpMethods.Post };
    req.Headers["X-ss-id"] = m.GetBody().SessionId;
    var response = ServiceController.ExecuteMessage(m, req);
    return response;
});
```

### Global Filters vs Action Filters

One important difference worth re-iterating is that Filter Attribute declared on the Service class are top-level filters executed during Global Request filters which are only executed for HTTP Requests:

```csharp
[Authenticate] //Top-level Filter Attribute - only executed for HTTP Requests
public class MqAuthOnlyService : Service 
{
    public object Any(AuthOnly request)
    {
        var session = base.SessionAs<AuthUserSession>();
        return new AuthOnlyResponse {
            Result = "Hello, {0}! Your UserName is {1}"
                .Fmt(request.Name, session.UserAuthName)
        };
    }
}
```

This will allow you to separate behavior for external HTTP Requests from internal MQ Requests.

To validate both HTTP and MQ Requests, place the `[Authenticate]` attribute on the method itself, e.g:

```csharp
public class AuthOnlyService : Service 
{
    [Authenticate] //Authenticate both HTTP and MQ Requests
    public object Any(AuthOnly request)
    {
        var session = base.SessionAs<AuthUserSession>(); 
        return new AuthOnlyResponse {
            Result = "Hello, {0}! Your UserName is {1}"
                .Fmt(request.Name, session.UserAuthName)
        };
    }
}
```
